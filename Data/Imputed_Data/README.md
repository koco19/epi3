# Data

Data used for the statistical epidemiological analysis of the prospective Covid-19 cohort study in Munich KoCo19. 

## Structure

The folder `/Imputed_Data` contains the following data:

* `Koco_R5latest_data_seedx.RDS`: Similar data to `Data/R5/R5_CompleteData_NC.RDS` but with imputed values for the vaccination status and the serological status. These data are obtained from the R script `Seroprevalence/Scripts/Imputation.R` and are used for the computation of the sero-estimates of rounds 3, 4 and 5.
