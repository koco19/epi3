# Seroprevalence analyses

Codes for the analyses to compute the seroprevalence estimates. 

## Structure

The folder `/Results/R5` contains the following files:

* `r5_cum_sp_w_seedx.csv`: Weighted seroprevalence estimates for round 5 calibrated on the vaccintation status using different imputed datasets (seeds x) produced by `/Seroprevalence/Scripts/Imputation.R`. These CSV files, obtained from `R5_Cumulative_Seroprevalence.R`, are not available.
* `r5_cum_sp_w_no_cal_seedx.csv`: Weighted seroprevalence estimates for round 5 not calibrated on the vaccintation status using different imputed datasets (seeds x) produced by `/Seroprevalence/Scripts/Imputation.R`. These CSV files, obtained from `R5_Cumulative_Seroprevalence_no_cal.R`, are not available.
