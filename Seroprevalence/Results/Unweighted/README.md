# Seroprevalence analyses

Codes for the analyses to compute the seroprevalence estimates. 

## Structure

The folder `/Results/Unweighted` contains the following files:

* `si_uw_seedx.RDS`: Unweighted sero-incidence estimates for the different rounds using different imputed datasets (seeds x) produced by `/Seroprevalence/Scripts/Imputation.R`. These RDS files, obtained from `Unweighted_seroestimates.R`, are not available.
* `si_vax_uw_seedx.RDS`: Unweighted sero-incidence estimates for the different rounds split according to the vaccination status using different imputed datasets (seeds x) produced by `/Seroprevalence/Scripts/Imputation.R`. These RDS files, obtained from `Unweighted_seroestimates.R`, are not available.
* `sp_vax_uw_seedx.RDS`: Unweighted seroprevalence estimates for the different rounds split according to the vaccination status using different imputed datasets (seeds x) produced by `/Seroprevalence/Scripts/Imputation.R`. These RDS files, obtained from `Unweighted_seroestimates.R`, are not available.
