# Seroprevalence analyses

Codes for the analyses to compute the seroprevalence estimates. 

## Structure

The folder `/Results/R3` contains the following files:

* `r3_cum_sp_w_seedx.csv`: Weighted seroprevalence estimates for round 3 calibrated on the vaccintation status using different imputed datasets (seeds x) produced by `/Seroprevalence/Scripts/Imputation.R`. These CSV files, obtained from `R3_Cumulative_Seroprevalence.R`, are not available.
* `r3_cum_sp_w_no_cal_seedx.csv`: Weighted seroprevalence estimates for round 3 not calibrated on the vaccintation status using different imputed datasets (seeds x) produced by `/Seroprevalence/Scripts/Imputation.R`. These CSV files, obtained from `R3_Cumulative_Seroprevalence_no_cal.R`, are not available.
